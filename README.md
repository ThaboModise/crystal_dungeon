# crystal_dungeon
This project is a mini puzzle game experiment, developed using the threejs editor.

This project is best run on a local server using the threejs editor due to dependencies which make it a nightmare to run it as a standalone html file.
Download the threejs master folder. Inside it you will find a folder containing the editor.

This project contains a folder and inside the folder are the following:
1. app.json
2. index.html
3. A js folder containing the threejs module file and an app.js file
4. An audio folder
5. An images folder

Instructions
1. First run a local server from the threejs editor directory and then open the editor.
2. In the editor click the file tab and then click open and then open the json file contained herein. This should load the project into the editor.
3. Before pressing play copy and paste the audio and images folders into the editor folder since this is where the files are retrieved in the code.
4. After completing the aforementioned instructions you can press play and enjoy the game.

Feel free to explore the code.Enjoy!
